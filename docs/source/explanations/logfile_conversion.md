# Logfile conversation

The process for converting logfiles from DJI drones to CSV files, have changed over time. From winter 2022 [AirData.com](https://airdata.com) provides the preferred solution.

The recommended tool for converting the log files to CSV is the windows program `TXTlogToCSVtool.exe` which can be downloaded from

Earlier that conversion could be done by uploading the flight log to [PhantomHelp](https://www.phantomhelp.com/LogViewer/Upload/) and Downloading the verbose csv. The verbose version is needed since the normal version lack video timestamps. Unfortunately PhantomHelp does not support the export of `verbose csv` at the moment.
