# Howto - Convert Logfiles to csv files
This document describes how to convert a logfile from a DJI drone into the .csv format that can be used with the Drone Video Measure programme.

The recommended tool for converting the log files to CSV is the windows program `TXTlogToCSVtool.exe` which can be downloaded from
[https://phantompilots.com](https://phantompilots.com/threads/tool-win-offline-txt-flightrecord-to-csv-converter.70428/).

## Alternative tools
Earlier that conversion could be done by uploading the flight log to [PhantomHelp](https://www.phantomhelp.com/LogViewer/Upload/) and Downloading the verbose csv. The verbose version is needed since the normal version lack video timestamps. Unfortunately PhantomHelp does not support the export of `verbose csv` at the moment.
