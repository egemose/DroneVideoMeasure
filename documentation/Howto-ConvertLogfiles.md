# Howto - Convert Logfiles to csv files
The flight log needs to be converted to csv format before it can be used by the Drone Video Measure software. This can be done by using the site [AirData.com](https://AirData.com). 

It should also be possible to link the drone directly with the [[AirData.com]] site. See this link for details:
